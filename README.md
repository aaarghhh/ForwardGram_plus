### For other development or support, please contact me via discord  [@Aaarghhh](aaarghhh).


## Description
__Forwardgram Plus (on Steroids)__ is a free and open source, telegram to discord message bot. It was creating starting from the idea of [Forwardgram](https://github.com/kkapuria3/Telegram-To-Discord-Forward-Bot) and fully refactored. It enables one to forward messages from Multiple Telegram channels to one (or more) Telegram/Discord channels of your own. This python bot monitors multiple telegram channels. When a new message/entity is sent, it will parse the response and forward it to a discord channel using your own personalized bot. This steroid version support a native translation and presents a label indicating the source of the message.



### Dependencies
